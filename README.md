# Simple Vtube Studio API example
This is a project I play around with [Vtube Studio API](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio) using [VTubeStudioJS](https://github.com/Hawkbat/VTubeStudioJS)


- [Example of toggle Hotkeys](http://github.1ppl.me/vts_api_test)
- [Example of changing ArtMeshes Tint](http://github.1ppl.me/vts_api_test/tint.html)

These examples doesn't enforce https, because you do need http to connect it over lan if using it on different device.

**p/s: currently you need to have beta version of Vtube Studio to use the API, please join their official discord to get the beta version.**
